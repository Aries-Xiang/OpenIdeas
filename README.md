a little repository of weird ideas as a new programmer

I'm totally a fresher of java, the java programmer is my job currently and java is becoming one of my hobby gradully.I hope to improve my skill and experience of programming here. By the way, my English reading skill may improve faster than my coding skill.lol haha
